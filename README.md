# Fetaure Checklist

✅ = Complete

❌ = Incomplete
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
❌ Start button that, well, starts the quiz. (Pretty self-explanatory, right?)

❌ A timer that counts down from 8 minutes. When a question is answered incorrectly, it subtracts 30 seconds from the clock. When it reaches 0, the quiz automatically ends with your score.

❌ 10 questions on the subject of coding. Each question will be multiple choice, with one correct answer out of 4 answer choices for each question.

❌ A final score display where you can sign your initials, just like an Arcade Machine! (~~Except less fun)
