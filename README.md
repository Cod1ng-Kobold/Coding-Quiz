# Fetaure Checklist

✅ = Complete

❌ = Incomplete
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
✅ Start button that, well, starts the quiz. (Pretty self-explanatory, right?)

✅ A timer that counts down from 30 seconds. When the timer reaches 0, the question is skipped and no points are obtained.

✅ 10 questions on the subject of coding. Each question will be multiple choice, with one correct answer out of 4 answer choices for each question.

❌ A final score display where you can sign your initials, just like an Arcade Machine! (~~Except less fun)
